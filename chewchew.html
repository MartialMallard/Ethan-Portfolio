            Chew Chew Train is a rogue-like management puzzle game where you must take care of spooky passengers that ride your train...
            except your train also uses passenger as fuel! Will you be able to reach the mysterious End of the Line or will you be eaten
            by your own train first? There's only one way to find out!

                        System Design - All Aboard!
                    </p>
                    <p class="after-section-paragraph">
                        The most defining factor of Chew Chew Train is the plethora of unique interactions that can happen between passengers.
                        These restrictions can range from simply keeping two different monster types out of the same cabin, to even
                        transforming a random passenger to a new type of monster.
                    </p>
                    <p class="after-section-paragraph">
                        These interactions fuel the meat of the game, figuratively and literally! Making sure that your passengers don't kill each other
                        allows the player to feed them back to your train and keep moving forward.
                    </p>
                    <p class="after-section-paragraph">
                        As part of the design process, I was tasked with brainstorming some of these unique effects
                        and interactions, as well as designing the UI to communicate relevant information about passenger
                        behaviors.

                        Level Design and Programming
                    </p>
                    <p class="after-section-paragraph">
                        The main inspiration I took from while programming the map generation was from Slay the Spire's maze-like layouts.
                        However, we had different design considerations when it came to communicating information that required us to branch out a bit.
                    </p>
                    <p class="after-section-paragraph">
                        The decision to make a roguelike management game neccessitated two major considerations, the first of which being
                        randomized levels. My approach towards making the routing through these randomized levels more impactful was through 
                        the use of stage gimmicks.
                    </p>
                    <p class="after-section-paragraph">
                        Stage gimmicks are modifiers that change the way that you interact with your cars and passengers. They serve to make the
                        passenger interactions slightly more difficult.

                        System Design - Random Encounters
                    </p>
                    <p class="after-section-paragraph">
                        The second of the two major considerations that a roguelike game necessitates is random rewards. We had briefly discussed multiple
                        methods to increase complexity throughout the game, but the delivery method we settled on was station encounters.
                    </p>
                    <p class="after-section-paragraph">
                        Station encounters are guaranteed small cutscenes at the end of each level, featuring a handful of recurring characters. These events
                        allowed us a flavorful way to ramp up game difficulty and offer interesting choices to players through exchange offers and increased
                        train capacity. The more space you have, the more you have to pay attention to future interactions.
