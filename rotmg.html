                    Realm of the Mad God (RotMG) is a massively-multiplayer perma-death RPG and also a bullet hell shooter. You play as a
                    hero of the realm, slaying monsters and crawling dungeons to eventually defeat the Mad God Oryx-- as the game's title suggests--
                    ad infinitum.

                <p class="after-section-paragraph">
                    The twist is that in contrast to many similarly-themed MMORPGs, RotMG's combat borrows from the often insanely
                    difficult bullet hell games such as Touhou to make moment-to-moment interactions intense and immediately impactful. The game's
                    unique position as a genre mashup between a handful of very different types of games also makes it uniquely difficult to design content for.

            I would consider the Spectral Penitentiary to be my capstone project. It was developed entirely from scratch
            within the course of 2 years, and I encountered many unique challenges that forced me to come up with
            creative solutions.

                    </p>
                    <p class="after-section-bulletpoint">
                        - Provide a uniquely non-linear gameplay experience by randomly distributing objectives
                        throughout the level

                    <p class="after-section-bulletpoint">
                        - Utilize the game's roguelike aspects to better sustain an infinitely replayable experience,
                        reducing burnout on repeated play
                    </p>
                    <p class="after-section-bulletpoint">
                        - Foster higher-paced interactions to engage players at a more streamlined pace
                    </p>
                    <p class="after-section-bulletpoint">
                        - Apply adaptive difficulty scaling to accomodate for a wider range of player skill levels
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="after-section-text">
                    <p class="after-section-paragraph">
                        Procedural generation is a commonly used feature in rogue-like games in order to increase
                        the replay value and scalability of game content through semi-randomized level generation.
                        Unfortunately, RotMG's implementation lacks a crucial element that helps tie these sorts of
                        systems together-- loops!
                    </p>
                    <p class="after-section-paragraph">
                        Loops are crucial to invoking a sense of meaningful navigation, allowing both extra ways to path towards
                        a destination and giving more freedom to explore. Years of experience within the game's development sphere
                        have made it abundantly clear that this omission in dungeon generation mostly punishes players for going the wrong 
                        direction, and a lack of available backtracking tools exacerbates this problem.

                        System Design - Creating Non-Linearity
                    </p>
                    <p class="after-section-paragraph">
                        I spent a very long time trying to find a workaround to this issue that played within the constraints of the dungeon
                        generation algorithm. After a certain point however, I decided that the only way I was going to bypass this problem
                        was to view it in the same way that I had originally approached it-- forcing the loops into existence and making my own
                        dungeon generation algorithm.
                    </p>
                    <p class="after-section-paragraph">
                        Most of the following process involved me improvising a method of randomly generating room layouts in predetermined locations,
                        utilizing the existing scripting tools. I had to manually implement multiple different randomization features that the game's original
                        algorithm would have automatically done, but writing the functions myself allowed me much greater control over smaller gameplay
                        tweaks. Through a lot of iteration I was able to create the non-linear experience I had originally wanted, but it came with several concessions.

                        Level Design - Backed Into 4 Corners
                    </p>
                    <p class="after-section-paragraph">
                        One of the most challenging parts of the design process was made apparent through the restrictions of pre-generated room dimensions. Every single
                        room that I created needed to be an exact size, be accessible from all four cardinal directions, and still provide
                        enough variety so you don't feel like you're encountering the same room more than once.
                    </p>
                    <p class="after-section-paragraph">
                        In total, the dungeon has over 50 different unique room types! Needless to say, it was extremely exhausting, but I still found myself wishing I had
                        chosen larger room dimensions. To avoid the homogenization of room layouts within my constraints however, I needed diversify the available challenges in each room.
                    </p>
                    <p class="after-section-paragraph">
                        One of the solutions that I utilized was to make multiple branches of the dungeon. After entering, you are offered two out of the four
                        possible branches of the dungeon. This extra degree of randomness allowed me to save resources on unique room layouts by providing different challenges based on
                        the theme of their respective branch.
                    </p>
                    <p class="after-section-paragraph">
                        This served two important purposes. The first of which was allowing me to utilize zone-specific mechanics to influence
                        player pathing rather than rely entirely on the tile layouts. The second of which involved reimagining the classic dungeon
                        gameplay loop to accomodate for a wider range of player archetypes.

                        System Design - Building for Accessibility
                    </p>
                    <p class="after-section-paragraph">
                        In most typical MMORPGs, endgame content usually consists of high-duration and high-commitment activities. While this is definitely something that endgame players
                        want (or begrudgingly deal with), my dungeon was built with the idea that the content should be accessible to a wide array of player duration and commitment levels.
                        This required me to adopt a different gameplay loop as opposed to much of the game's content.
                    </p>
                    <p class="after-section-paragraph">
                        Contrary to the linear progression of the classic dungeon loop, Spectral Penitentiary provides a more varied and rewarding gameplay loop by lowering
                        necessary commitment and utilizing a prolonged reward pacing.
                    </p>
                    <p class="after-section-paragraph">
                        Providing multiple different ways to play through content was a necessary consideration in my opinion. After all, I think that it would be a waste of
                        development time to not take advantage of adaptive content.

                    <p class="after-section-paragraph">
                        Overall, this project emerged as a fairly large technical achievment, although the massive initial scope led to this project lasting a lot longer than I 
                        had anticipated (2 years!). I learned a lot through trial and error, especially since there was a lack of documentation at the time I started learning how to
                        work with the limited tools. My work didn't come without regrets though, and I wish that I utilized more opportunities to get feedback on the intuitiveness of
                        some mechanics, as I noticed that the visual communication of certain elements were seen as completely arbitray information rather than useful.

                    <p class="after-section-paragraph">
                        At the end of the day, players seemed to love it though. In my book, I'd call that a success.
