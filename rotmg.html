                <p class="project-separate-bullet-point">
                    - Developed a full-length endgame difficulty level from scratch as part of the User-Generated Content program, including multiple new bosses, enemies, and items.
                </p>
                <p class="project-separate-bullet-point">
                    - Worked with the design team to provide additional boss and enemy content to major updates.
                </p>
                <p class="project-separate-bullet-point">
                    - Currently train and assist new members of the User-Generated content team with designing content and becoming more familiar with the development tools.
                </p>
                <p class="project-separate-bullet-point">
                    - Provided specs for new scripting functions that are used within the official design team.
                </p>
                <p class="project-separate-bullet-point">
                    - Participated in discussions and planning with the official design team to spec out content for future updates.
                </p>
                <p class="project-separate-bullet-point">
                    - Participated in weekly closed testing sessions as part of the game's Closed Testing program, involving providing detailed bug reports and reproduction steps.

                    Realm of the Mad God (RotMG) is a massively-multiplayer perma-death RPG and also a bullet hell shooter. You play as a
                    hero of the realm, slaying monsters and crawling dungeons to eventually defeat the Mad God Oryx-- as the game's title suggests--
                    ad infinitum. The twist is that in contrast to many similarly-themed MMORPGs, RotMG's combat borrows from the often insanely
                    difficult bullet hell games such as Touhou to make moment-to-moment interactions intense and immediately impactful. The game's
                    unique position as a genre mashup between a handful of very different types of games also makes it uniquely difficult to design content for.

                <p class="after-section-paragraph">
                    Working on Realm of the Mad God has taught me a lot about the value of knowing how your tools
                    work and how you can leverage creativity to compensate for a more limited development toolkit.

                        - Provide a uniquely non-linear gameplay experience by randomly distributing objectives

                        The Spectral Penitentiary was developed entirely from scratch within the course of 2 years.
                        During the course of its development I encountered many unique challenges that required me to innovate
                        and apply brand-new solutions.

                    <p class="after-section-paragraph">
                        Procedural generation is a commonly used feature in rogue-like games in order to increase
                        the replay value and scalability of game content, and Realm of the Mad God is no different
                        when it comes to using to generating dungeon levels.
                        
                        RotMG uses a relatively linear dungeon generation algorithm. After a starting room is generated,
                        the algorithm attempts to build a path out of a pool of defined rooms up until a final point, which
                        is defined as a boss room.
                        
                        Afterwards, side branches are built on specific rooms that are eligible to extend from. These side branches
                        are supposed to be what makes the dungeon-crawling aspect of the game appealing, but it poses a few specific
                        problems within the context of the game.
