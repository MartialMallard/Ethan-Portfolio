                <p class="project-separate-bullet-point">
                    - Developed a full-length endgame difficulty level from scratch as part of the User-Generated Content program, including multiple new bosses, enemies, and items.
                </p>
                <p class="project-separate-bullet-point">
                    - Worked with the design team to provide additional boss and enemy content to major updates.
                </p>
                <p class="project-separate-bullet-point">
                    - Currently train and assist new members of the User-Generated content team with designing content and becoming more familiar with the development tools.
                </p>
                <p class="project-separate-bullet-point">
                    - Provided specs for new scripting functions that are used within the official design team.
                </p>
                <p class="project-separate-bullet-point">
                    - Participated in discussions and planning with the official design team to spec out content for future updates.
                </p>
                <p class="project-separate-bullet-point">
                    - Participated in weekly closed testing sessions as part of the game's Closed Testing program, involving providing detailed bug reports and reproduction steps.

                    Realm of the Mad God (RotMG) is a massively-multiplayer perma-death RPG and also a bullet hell shooter. You play as a
                    hero of the realm, slaying monsters and crawling dungeons to eventually defeat the Mad God Oryx-- as the game's title suggests--
                    ad infinitum.
                </p>
                <p class="after-section-paragraph">
                    The twist is that in contrast to many similarly-themed MMORPGs, RotMG's combat borrows from the often insanely
                    difficult bullet hell games such as Touhou to make moment-to-moment interactions intense and immediately impactful. The game's
                    unique position as a genre mashup between a handful of very different types of games also makes it uniquely difficult to design content for.
                </p>
                <p class="after-section-paragraph">
                    Working on Realm of the Mad God has taught me a lot about the value of knowing how your tools
                    work and how you can leverage creativity to compensate for a more limited development toolkit.

            I would consider the Spectral Penitentiary to be my capstone project. It was developed entirely from scratch
            within the course of 2 years, and I encountered many unique challenges that forced me to come up with
            creative solutions.

                        My design goals for this project were to:
                    </p>
                    <p class="after-section-bulletpoint">
                        - Provide a uniquely non-linear gameplay experience by randomly distributing objectives
                        throughout the level
                    </p>
                    <p class="after-section-bulletpoint">
                        - Build a level that bypasses the limitations of the game's level-generation
                    </p>
                    <p class="after-section-bulletpoint">
                        - Utilize the game's roguelike aspects to better sustain an infinitely replayable experience,
                        reducing burnout on repeated play
                    </p>
                    <p class="after-section-bulletpoint">
                        - Foster higher-paced interactions to engage players at a more streamlined pace
                    </p>
                    <p class="after-section-bulletpoint">
                        - Apply adaptive difficulty scaling to accomodate for a wider range of player skill levels
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="after-section-text">
                    <p class="after-section-paragraph">
                        Procedural generation is a commonly used feature in rogue-like games in order to increase
                        the replay value and scalability of game content through semi-randomized level generation.
                        Unfortunately, RotMG's implementation lacks a crucial element that helps tie these sorts of
                        systems together-- loops!
