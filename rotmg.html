        <p class="after-description" style="width: 70%;">
            I had originally started my close involvement with Realm of the Mad God back in 2021, where during a time of personal struggle I wrote and published a
            game design essay to the community's subreddit that detailed some of the most prevalent issues facing the game. This was met with a large amount of community
            discussion and even led to recognition by the official design team at that time, which springboarded towards being part of the first wave of closed testers that weren't
            strictly invited through personal recommendation.
        </p>
        <p class="after-description" style="width: 70%;">
            The opportunity provided to me through this experience wasn't without struggle, however. I was thrust into an environment where many veterans of both the Closed Testing
            and User-Generated Content programs had left the team, with the only thing left behind for me to work with was outdated documentation. At that point, it became evident that
            I would have to be the person to take the torch if the program were to survive.
        </p>
        <p class="after-description" style="width: 70%;">
            During the following year, I spent my time independently learning through the remaining documentation and updating it myself. It was only towards the tail-end
            of this period that the program started to recover, as new faces decided to stick around longer and were more willing to interact with the existing documentation.
            Through my effort of consistent activity, I was able to provide a foundation for the community of User-Generated Content members to recover.
        </p>
        <p class="after-description" style="width: 75%;">
            My biggest accomplishment working on Realm of the Mad God is my full-length endgame dungeon project, the Spectral Penitentiary.

                    Spectral Penitentiary was developed entirely from scratch within the course of 2 years.
                    During this period of time, I sought out to find solutions for one of the most prevalent
                    issues experienced with the game's level design, being the dungeon generation algorithm.
